                <p>Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!</p>
            
                <h2>Spaghetti alla Carbonara Ingredients</h2>

                <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
                <h2>Preparation steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.</li>
                <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
